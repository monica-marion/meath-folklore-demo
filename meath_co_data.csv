It is believed by many people in this district (Oldbridge), that most of Mr. Coddington's fields are enchanted.  There is one field along the river and on Hallow Eve little red men are supposed to have been seen dancing in it.On this night many years ago there was an old man walking home across this field when he saw these little red men playing football.  They stopped playing when they saw the old man coming and ran up to him and asked him to kick their football.  He did so, and kicked it so far that it disappeared out of their sights.  They were very cross when they saw what he had done, and they flew at him in a rage and beat him until he was nearly dead.  Then they disappeared.

One day in the year 1887 there was a man going through Coddington's Bull Park, Oldbridge.  He had a young boy with him, but when he was leaving the field he couldn't find the boy so he went back to look for him.  Halfway back he partly lost his sight and he could not get out of the field.  But the boy saw him and called him and showed him the way.  It is thought that the man stepped on a 'stray sod' and that the fairies worked a spell over him.

Michael Collier was born in Bellewstown in the parish of Duleek many years ago.  He was the son of respected people but he fell in with a band of thieves and soon he became one himself, and after some time he became their leader.In his time he robbed many mail-carts and stage coaches, and it is said that during all his time he only killed one man.  He often stopped in Donore for a night or two.But one night he came to a cottage in the country and he asked the woman of the house if she would give him shelter until  morning.  During the night the woman told him that she would have to leave the house in the morning as she had no money to pay the rent.  collier gave the woman £5, so when the landlord came next morning she gave him the rent.  No sooner had the man gone when Collier followed him and robbed him of the money which he gave back to the poor woman.It is said that he once spanned the Boyne with a long pole on which he crossed the river and so evaded his pursuers. One good thing about Collier was that he robbed the rich and gave it to the poor. He afterwards died in the Workhouse.     Told by - Mrs O'Toole (about 56) Donore, Drogheda.

Michael Collier known as ""Collier the Robber"" from time to time stayed in the Forge Field in front of Mr. Coddington's house, Oldbridge.Michael was very good to the poor.  He used to go into the fields and dig the potatoes and put them in sacks and give them to some needy person.Once when he was being followed by the police he got into a bag of potatoes in a field, and by evening himself with potatoes he escaped being caught.He never kept anything for himself, but gave all to the poor.  He used to pose as a tramp so that he could carry out his plans without being detected.

pellics.Every year sallies were cut and brought across the river to the 'sally' green and stored in the sally shed.  They were left there for some time and then taken to the 'sally' hole beside the shed.The sallies were put into the hole and water was poured over them, and they were left for some weeks to steep.  This was done to soften the wood and make it easy to bend.  When the sallies were taken out of the 'sally' hole they were brought up to Oldbridge where the men of the village made them into pellics.John Cluskey who lives in Oldbridge still makes pellics and he also puts bottoms in old ones.

The Boyne is only a short distance from the village.Donore R.C. church is in the village of Donore and it is dedicated to the Nativity of Our Blessed lady.  It was built over a hundred years ago (so says John Martin (80) Donore) from Sheephouse limestone, chiselled by the stonecutters of the district.  There are two priests buried inside in the Church - Rev. P. J. O'Farrell, P.P., who died Dec. 11th 1866, and Rev. N. Power, P.P., who died Nov. 24th 1874.Long ago there was a ""pattern"" held every year on the second Sunday in Sept. It was an event looked forward to by young and old, but the custom died out about 50 years ago.  There used to be house-to-house collections,  and some of the money collected went towards the up-keep of the graveyard, and some of it was spent in merry-making.  The people marched to the Churchyard in processional order, and there elected a mayor who was put riding on an ass.  After much speeching they dispersed, but the grown-ups met at night at what was called the ""Pattern Ball"".  The Churchyard

The only local poet who seems to be remembered and quoted by the people of this district is Mathew Lynch who lived at Platten in what was called the ""herd's"" house. He was a ploughman in the employment of Mrs Gradwell, Platten Hall, Drogheda. He is described as having been a very gentle simple-minded man, and his one delight and hobby was composing poetry (which was quite spontaneous) about local persons and events. He died about 65 years ago and is buried in Duleek Cemetery. He was much loved by the people. His daughter, Margaret Lynch, who died about five years ago was also fond of making poetry, and altho' some of it was written down there is none of it to be found. Two of Mathew Lynch's grandsons - Thomas McCormac and Mathew McCormac - are living in the parish of Donore, and a niece lives in Co. Dublin. Got from - Thomas McCormac, Donore, Drogheda, who is a grandson of the late Mathew Lynch mentioned above.

Where our Saviour dear our debts to clear shed His pure, precious Blood,Could I commend all tongues to praise Him for the same they should.The high and low, the friend and foe, all meet there face to face,From climes remotest of the earth that came of Adam's race.The drunken and deluded man meets with his virtuous wifeWhom he by his debaucheries robbed of the means of life.In a firey fury in her husband's train she next beholds her sonCrying, ""Mother dear, will you interfere, for now I am undone"", The mother seems to flatter none, but says to him again""I have apprised you of this day, but it was all in vain.My son, I loved you tenderly when I fed you at my breast,But soon you turned your back to me and became an imp unblest.I oft sat weeping all alone lamenting your sad case,When sight of grief without relief and tears bedewed my face.

The Judge appear to their surprise in great authority,At His approach nigh to this earth that dyed all o'er with sinThe mountains bound like startled lambs that flee from hill and glen. The seas break forth in waves of fire o'er its usual strand,Resolved no more, back to retire, till revenged on guilty man.The earth will shake and whirlwinds break and throw down lofty towers,Whilst thunder rolls from pole to pole and lightning falls in showers.The sun and moon become obscure that now shine clean and bright,Whilst the proud monarchs of the earth stand in a trembling fright.The wretch will say, ""Ye mountains high attend to my sad moan,And screen me from the wrathful Lamb that sits upon the throne"".But blessed are they, who in their day, have kept the Lord's command,For bright and pure they stand secure that day at His right hand.Whilst those proud, vain and wicked ones of all glad hopes befeft

Then they tied it to a piece of a furze bush which they carried around with them.  They do not kill the wren now.People are usually very kind to the ""wren boys"".  They give them money or some of the Christmas good things - pudding etc.The money collected is divided equally among the boys taking part.

The Famine TimesThe potatoes decayed in the ground and some of them didn't grow at all. The year before the famine the potatoes were so plentiful that they were sold for ten pence a barrel, and rather than sell them at that price the people threw them in the ditches or buried them in the ground.The year before the seed potatoes had to be brought in from England. They were sown in drills and there was a fairly good crop. But everyone had not potatoes sown. It was only the rich who could afford to buy them because they were so dear. When the seed potatoes were brought into the country they were very small and although they were small they had to be cut much smaller, and if there was an eye at all in the piece it would be sown. The food the people had instead of potatoes was porridge made from Indian meal, and this they were very glad to eat. There was a very bad sickness after the famine and numbers of people died. The rich people of the district did give a little help to the poor, and at nearly every cross-roads during the famine times there used to be a man with a weighing scales.

When the priest was returning he met the man again, and this time he asked the priest what prayers he prayed on him as all his potatoes had gone bad.  The priest said that he didn't pray any prayers on him, but when he refused to give potatoes to the poor he refused them to God.

The Famine TimesDuring the famine the poor people of the district suffered terribly. A great number died either from starvation or from sickness brought on by the bad food.  Most of the poor people depended on the potatoes, and when they failed, the only food they had to eat  was boiled oaten meal mixed with cabbage. The crop decayed in the ground. the next year the potatoes were sown broadcast.

The Famine TimesThe year before the famine potatoes were very plentiful. They were dug up and thrown into ditches. The very next year the blight came on them and they decayed in the ground. Hardly any of them were saved. During the famine it was not unusual to see people rooting in the fields hoping to find even a piece of decayed turnip.  They were glad to walk miles for some Indian meal to make porridge. Numbers of people died from starvation and from a terrible plague called cholera which came after the famine.

The Local LandlordThe local landlord was Mr Crafford (Crawford). He was not considered a good landlord. Every year he made the tenants pay a certain amount either in kind or in money. He used to let farms at a certain rent, and if anyone else was able to pay a higher rent he would get the land and the tenant would get notice to leave, and if he didn't leave he would be evicted. If a tenant wanted to cut down a tree he had to get permission from the landlord, and it was only on rare occasions that permission was given. The permission was given if the tenant wanted a post to put under his house to keep it up or for fencing, but not for firewood. The landlord first came into possession of the land during the Cromwellian plantations. A Mr Johnston owned the land before Mr Crafford, for when Mr Johnston died Mr Crafford married one of Mr Johnston's daughters. The agent for Mr Crafford was Mr Richard Hamell. He was a very cruel  agent to the poor people who were not able to pay their rents.

The Local LandlordsMr Crafford (Crawford) was the landlord and he owned all the land around Donore. He lived in Belfast and Mr Coddington looked after the land for him. It was after the Battle of the Boyne that the land was given to Mr Crafford. It was divided into small farms, and the tenants were not allowed to cut down  trees for firewood, nor had they any claim to any game on the farms.

The Doggett family of TubberfinnThe Dogetts have lived in Tubberfinn for nearly 300 years. They first came to live there about the year 1664. Two of the Doggetts fought at the Battle of the Boyne 1690. Their names were James and Richard.  The first Doggett family lived up on the hills called the ""Molly Moors"" and they used to get up to their house by means of a 'dish wheel' cart. These carts were so called because their wheels were shaped like butter-dishes. The two Doggett brothers who fought in  the Battle of the Boyne were killed at Kellystown. Their bodies were conveyed to Donore churchyard by means of the dish-wheeled cart.  The first Doggett family consisted of seven boys and five girls. The boys all went into the world as different tradesmen. Some of them became coopers, (these were men who made churns, butter-dishes, and other wooden vessels) and others of them became farriers (men who made harness). Both these trades are very old and have died out in this district. Some of the Doggett boys went to sea, and the girls either married or remained at home to work.  As years rolled on the Doggets moved down towards the newly made road. The first Doggett family lived beside the well, then they built a house beside the gate of the three cornered field. The house

When Father Plunkett (whose headstone is still to be seen in Donore Churchyard with the inscription - Father Plunkett 1733) said mass on Doggett's hills during the Penal days he was chased day and night by the priest hunters, and there was a great price on his head. One day he was being chased and he ran through Doggett's haggard.  The Doggetts saw him and hid him under the hay in one of the barns and this saved him from the priest hunters.

Father Christopher Doggett.  (Tubberfinn, Donore, Drogheda)The exact date of Father Doggett's birth is not known but he was ordained a priest in 1857.  It was his wish to go to America after he was ordained, and while he was waiting for permission to come from the Pope he used to say Mass for the people of Donore in Donore Parish Church.Whilst he lived in America he did much for the people who loved and honoured him until he died inthe year 1876 (28th Aug).  He was a very unselfish man and gave all he had to the poor, so much so, that when he died he didn't leave behind money enough to bury him.

ChurchyardsThere are two churchyards in the Parish of Donore - Donore Churchyard (the famous Hill of Donore) and the Leck.  Both are very old and still used as burial grounds.Donore churchyard is situated on a hill about a mile from the village of Donore and is approached from the main road by a lane (almost 1/2 mile in length).  It is said that long ago there were three passes to the Hill of Donore - one from the Sheephouse - Drogheda Road, one from Tubberfinn, and the present one (at Mr. Smith's)The view from the Hill of Donore  on a clear day is one of the finest in Ireland.  Right underneath to the N.W. we look down on Oldbridge (scene of the Battle of the Boyne) King William's Glen, and the lovely woods of Townley Hall.  To the N.E. are the Mountains of Mourne, distinctly visible.To the East the town of Drogheda with its spires and fine viaduct, and right out to the sea where one can actually see the mouth of the river.  To the South we see some very fine country and away in the distance the outline of the Dublin Mountains.  The view from the Hill of Donore is very pleasing and well worth seeing.

Churchyards.The graveyard is circular in shape, and almost in the middle are the ruins of an old church which local tradition says was destroyed by Cromwell. About halfways between the entrance gate and the old church, and on a line with the entrance gate are the graves of two priests marked by two headstones - one much smaller than the other.The large one marks the grave of Father Byrne and the inscription reads: -Hic: Jacit: Fr. Joanne Byrne Ordinispreedi catorum hujus parochiee QuondamPastor. Requiescat in pace.On the smaller one is the very simple inscription:-FATHER JAMES PLUNKETT 1733.Both of these priests laboured in the Parish of Donore.The Abbott Barnewell is said to be buried in the ruins of the old church in Donore Cemetery.  He died about 1644.

Food in Olden TimesIn this district long ago the people ate but three meals every day - breakfast, dinner, and supper.  They rose very early because as a rule they started work at 6 o'c in Summer, and at daylight in winter.  They usually worked two hours or more before they had breakfast, which in most cases was Oaten Porridge, and sometimes ""Indian"" Porridge which was made from Indian meal.  The dinner at mid-day usually consisted of potatoes and milk.  Fresh meat was seldom eaten, but those who could afford it had sometimes home-cured bacon.  Very little use was made of vegetables.  For supper they again had Porridge. Tea was luxury and was only used by the well-to-do.They made their own bread which they baked on a griddle.  The bread mostly used was Wheaten Bread and Oaten Bread.  The people were very healthy.Got from - Christopher Reilly (aged about 37) Oldbridge, Drogheda.Anna Reilly (Scoláire)

Food in Olden TimesThe people long ago had four meals a day.  They got up at six in the morning and they worked until nine.  Then they had breakfast which consisted of porridge.  The dinner consisted of potatoes and milk.  When the potatoes were boiled they were emptied into a basket called a ""scuddle""  and allowed to drain.  This was done outside.  Then the potatoes were brought into the kitchen and the basket was placed in the middle of the floor and the family used to sit on stools around it.  Each one had a noggin of buttermilk to drink with the potatoes.The people long ago made their own bread - leaven bread, meslin bread, and barm bread. The meslin bread was almost black and not at all palatable.Leaven bread is still made in this district and is a great boon to people where buttermilk is hard to get.

The oaten bread was baked on a stand in front of the fire and it was called a ""greanac”.The wheaten bread was baked on a griddle and it was very good for children who were after getting their teeth.The leaven bread was baked on a griddle.

Churns and ChurningChurnsWe have a churn at home and it is like a wooden barrel.  When it is being used it is put on a stand.  It has a handle by which it is turned.  There is a lid on it, and in the centre of the lid there is a round piece of glass.  When this glass is clear and when the butter can be seen by tilting the churn to one side we know that the milk is sufficiently churned.  There is a plug on the lid which is pressed to let the air out, and another plug to let the milk out.Churning can be done more quickly in Summer than in Winter.  If even the tiniest bit of sugar gets into the milk it makes it impossible to churn.It is said that one day long ago a man was walking along a road. It was a very warm Summer's day and he had a bottle of milk in his pocket.  As he was walking, the milk was being shaken up and down.  With the constant shaking and the heat the cream in the milk became butter.  This is the way in which churning was discovered.Frances O'Toole (Scolaire)Got from my mother - Mrs O'Toole, Donore, Drogheda, (aged 58)

Churns and ChurningLong ago churns were worked by horse power.  The churn was in a frame in a pit.  It was worked by one or two horses, and the horses used to walk round the pit.The ""dash"" churn was much used long ago.  This churn was like a barrel with a lid on it.  There was a small round hole in the lid through which the handle of the dash came. The churning was done by lifting the dash up and down, and beating the milk with the head of the dash.Barrel churns are mostly used in this district now.  If anyone comes into a house while the churning is going on he usually takes a turn, as it thought to be unlucky not to do so.Sometimes the dash was attached to a beam in the ceiling.Got from - John Victory (60) Donore, DroghedaGerard Victory (Scoláire)Buttermilk is used as a drink.

In the windter time there is hot water put into the churning, and in the Summer cold water is put in.  There is a metal container at the bottom of the churn and it is through a small hole in this that the water is put in.  The water is added to help the churning.Generally twice a week there is a churning.Churning is easier to do in Summer because the cream thickens more quickly.  Sometimes in Winter people have to put teh cream in a warm place to help it to thicken.Long ago we had a ""dash"" churn, and the dash was fastened to the ceiling.

Agricultural Implements and Household UtensilsThe Flail is a very old farm implement.  It was used to beat the grain from the corn.  It was composed of two pieces of wood (one longer than the other) and joined together by a piece of leather.  The leather served as a hinge.  It was used in this district long ago.Wooden Ploughs were very much used long ago.  They were very roughly made.  The front end of the plough - the part which was driven through the soil - was made of steel, and was known as the ""nib"" of the plough.The Scythe is an old farm implement which was sometimes used long ago for cutting the corn.  It is now used in the district for cutting thistles and nettles.Peggie McGuinness (Scolaire)Got from: Patrick McGuinnes (aged 50)OldbridgeDrogheda

Agricultural Implements and Household UtensilsThe Wooden Plough was used about 70 years ago.  It was made completely of wood.  It had no wheel on it an it was pulled by one horse.The Sod Crusher was used for breaking the sods on fields that were freshly ploughed.  It was made of very rough boards and there was a seat on top it it, and it was pulled by one horse.Reaping Hook. The reaping hook was a small implement used for cutting corn.  It was semi-circular in shape with a wooden handle at one end.  It was sometimes likened to a sickle moon.  It had a very sharp edge.   (Reaping hooks are not used at all now).The Flail was used for threshing the corn long ago.  Four sheaves were threshed together and when the corn was separated from the straw, the straw was gathered into a heap, and the corn was winnowed to separate the grain from the chaff.Spoke-wheel Carts were used about 60 years ago.The spoke-wheel cart had no sides on it and no springs underneath, and this cart was used on the farm as well as for going to market.

Agricultural ImplementsA sling was a fork with a very long handle.  The reason why it was so long was because it was used for pitching sheaves of corn.A Reaping Hoot was like a new mood with a short handle at one end of the blade.  It was used for cutting corn.The Flail was made of two sticks fastened together by a piece of leather.  The corn used to be threshed on a level floor, but the corn had then to be winnowed.The Winnowing Maching was like a big box with a handle on the side of it.  The handle was like the handle of a turnip-cutter.  The winnowing separated the corn from the chaff.  The chaff came out one top and the corn came out at the bottom.The Horse Mill was like the mill which is used at present, but it was much smaller.  There was a shaft out of the side of it and it was drawn by two horses.  The horses, yoked to the shaft, walked round in a circle, and this set the works in motion which ground the corn.  A ""Creepy"" was a small three-legged stool.Gerard Victory (Scoláire)Got from John Victory (aged 60)Donore, Drogheda

Noggins were used log ago instead of cups. These noggins were made of wood with one ear or handle on the rim and bound with bands of tin or silver. it was the pride of every housewife to keep the noggins scoured as white as possible and the bands shining like silver [sketch].Platters made of wood or pewter were used instead of plates. ""Coppins"" were used instead of bowls and people usually ate their porridge out of them. Wooden spoons were much used and were kept in a small box on the wall. this box was divided into two parts., the spoons were kept in the back division and the salt was kept in the front one. Gridirons were used and also the Pitcher, which was an earthenware jug used for carrying water. Wooden pails were used instead of buckets. The besom was used instead of a brush. People made their own besoms from boxwood or brush wood.They wrote with the quill pen.Tallow candles and Rush Candles were largely used. The tallow candles were made from rendered fat. Lengths of scutched flax were dipped into the rendered fat and let dry. This was repeated several times and the candle was then ready for use. Rushes were treated in the same way.

Wake and Funeral CustomsLong ago when a person died the corpse was not ""laid out"" in the same way in which it is laid out now.  It was placed on a long table and a quilt put over it.  It was kept two nights in the house and not brought to the Chapel at all.  While the wake was going on every man who came into the house got a pipe and tobacco and every woman got a pinch of snuff.  When the day of the funeral came, men carried the corpse to the churchyard on a bier.Before the corpse was put into the coffin, it was wrapped in a sheet.  When the funeral was leaving the house the ""caoiners’ used to march before the corpse to the churchyard, and when the churchyard was reached the coffin was left on the edge of the grave and prayers were said over it.The ban-shee is still believed in in this district.Patrick Lennon (Scoláire)Got from - John Farrell (74)Sheephouse, Drogheda

Bird LoreThe birds commonly found in our district are:- Blackbirds, thrushes, crows, pigieons, robins, wrens, sparrows, finches, wagtails, linnets, yellow-hammers, strarlings and swallows.The blackbirds and thrushes build their nests in the bushes.  The crows in our district have built their nests in the trees overhanging the canal for years.  The pigeons build their nests mostly in the woods around, but sometimes they build them in low bushes in the wood, otherwise they build in high trees.  The robin builds in a mossy bank.  The wren makes a cosy nest in a bush or bank. The sparrow builds his nest in the eaves of thatched houses and on the rafters of old houses.  Yellow hammers build in bushes. Starlings build their nests in sheds and barns, and the swallow builds on the rafters in lofts and sheds.  The blackbird and the thrush make nests very much alike and very tidy.  They lay blue-green eggs and hatch them.  They sit on the eggs for three weeks.The crows and the pigeons build very untidy nests with twigs.  They both lay white-coloured eggs and sit on them for four weeks.  The robin's cosy nest of moss and hair is very hard to find.  She lays small eggs and they are white with a brown end on them.  She sits on them for three weeks.  The swallow builds a lovely nest of hay, mud and feathers.  The hay and mud are woven neatly together, and then the inside

It was also thought unlucky to strike another with an elder stick, because the person struck wouldn't grown another inch.3.

This place is never without a grey horse.  In the year 1649 Cromwell's horse which was on its way to Dublin got tired between Julianstown and White-Cross, and Colonel Peppard gave him a grey horse instead of the tired one.  In that time if a man did anything for Cromwell he was highly rewarded and he who did not was shurely put to death.Cromwell owned this castle and in return for the fresh horse he gave Colonel Peppard the castle and the deeds of the place.  That was the way Ballygarth Castle was found.  There are the remains of a Catholic Church and there is a cemetry there. Some of the cannon balls which were used by Cromwell can be seen yet there is also the remains of a cannon gun which was also used by him.

Maiden TowerThere is a large building at the mouth of the River Boyne.  It is called the Maiden Tower. The top of it is battlemented.  It is eighty feet in height.  The tower might have been used to carry a beacon for the ships coming into the river on their way to Drogheda. There are two stories in connection with it. One is, there was once a lady who husband was a soldier.  One day he was called away to the war he told her that if he returned dead they would hoist a black flag and if alive he would hoist a white one.  When the day came on which he was about to return the lady went up on the tower to see the boat return.  At last it came near and the soldier was safe but for a joke the sailors hoisted a black flag.  Then the lady seeing it jumped from the tower and broke her finger, that is why the other little building is there. It is called the Lady's Finger.  It is seventeen feet in height, both are in excellent state of preservation.  There was once a girl put out of her home she was sitting on some stones sewing, she wished that she had some place to shelter for the night.  While she was asleep the Tower sprung up over her.

Gormanston Castle is a large building. It has existed from about a century before Cromwell. One day Lord Gormanston was on the road between Dublin an Drogheda and Cromwell overtook him. He asked Lord Gormanston who he was and the Lord answered ""I am Lord Gormanston today and I'll be who you like tomorrow""; Cromwell then answered ""You are Lord Gormanston today and you'll be Lord Gormanston tomorrow"". When a person who dies in the castle the foxes cannot be kept away from the doors. When the hearse is going to the cemetery the foxes follow it in the woods. There are the remains of cannon guns used by Cromwell and some cannon balls there and they can be yet seen.

The village of Bettystown was very thickly populated before the Famine. A few years before the Famine the only food the people had were potatoes. The men when they were planting the potatoes would have a few cold potatoes in their pockets. They would take a piece of it and eat it and then then go on another bit and take another bite. Some person composed the following two lines:""May God above look down on us and pity us poor creatures,And send us food we can use and take away those potatoes""When the blight came on the potato they began to rot in the drills and pits. The people were dying like flies in the year 1846. They began to eat seaweed and the stalks of the potatoes.When one would be going to Mass or to work he would pass as many as seven bodies in one mile each had their mouth full of grass. About 55% of the people of the district died during the hard years of the Famine.

He was called this name because he had a large hump on his back.  One night he was beside the moat and he heard fairies singing inside it.  Their song was: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Sunday etc.  The man listened and then began: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday etc.  The head of the fairies then said ""who is putting on an addition to our song bring in here"".  The fairies came out and brought him in and asked him what they would like them to do for him, he asked them to take the hump from his back and they did so.

The Maiden TowerThe Maiden Tower is situated near the mouth of the River Boyne, about one mile from this school.  It is said that long ago there lived in this Tower a man and woman.  The man was a sailor and at certain times of the year he had to go to sea.  He always gave her a warning before going that if there were hoisted on the ships a black flag when returning from the voyage that was a sign he was drowned.  If there was hoisted a red flag he was returning safely.  The lady used to go up on the top of the Tower every day, looking out for the returning ship when it was due to return.  It was now three weeks since the ship was expected home and it had not come.  She waited and waited and began to despair.  At last, she went up as usual, but would not come down from the top to eat or drink.  At length she saw the ship coming a far-distance off.

Duleek is a small village in Co. Meath situated on the  River Nanny. It is about four Irish miles from Drogheda. It is situated in a hollow, the hill Corballis being to the North, with the Bárr and Gibb's Hill, culminating in Bellewstown Hill to the South. A census was taken for Parochial purposes by the Parish Priest in 1935, and it was computed that there are almost 2000 people in the Parish. (This includes other denominations than Catholics) Owing to its situation it is frequently flooded when rain continues for any length of time. The River Nanny overflows its bounds doing much damage to the meadows at the time. The smaller streams running into the Nanny also get swollen, and frequently  people are compelled to vacate their home. This is especially the case in the centre of the village, at Colliers', Connollys' and the Moat. Here there  will be several feet of water, and it is in the memory of at least one person that a pig had to be taken from a col  during such floods, and transported elsewhere. The Commons and the swamp known as the  Bugloch are also subject to flooding.The Irish name for Duleek is Daimhliag Cianáin, St Cianan's Stone Church. This Irish name was unknown until the revival of the language began. It is called D'leek', the first syllable being pronounced very short with a strong emphasis on the second syllable. The Patron Saint is St. Cianán whose feast Day is

the 24th November. There is no Patron Day or other celebrations, except that 24th Nov is an Offering day in the Parish. A fuller account of Saint Cianan will be given under another heading when the history of the village is being detailed.The principal buildings in the village are the Catholic Church, the Protestant Church, The Courthouse, the Police Barrack and the Boys' and Girls' School. A tablet in the  wall of the Catholic Church over the front door says it was erected by the exertions of the Rev. W. Kearney in 1812"". There is also a marble tablet in the inside of the Church erected to the memory of  Fr Gaughran who was Parish Priest here for 23 years and whose memory  is still greatly cherished by the people.There are the remains of an extensive flour and corn mill of which a description will be given later in this book.The first thing that will strike the visitor to Duleek is that it is a great fruit-producing village. Almost every family in the village has a fruit garden, mostly of raspberries, though there are   orchards of plums, damsons and apples also. It is a pleasant sight to visit the village in the late Spring and early Summer when the trees are abloom. The population is mostly of the labouring class, the men being engaged on the (?) the farmers or with the Co. Council on the Road or Quarries. They can attend to the raspberries  after their

ordinary day's work. A full account of the Raspberry industry will be found  further in this book.The G.N.R.  Station of Duleek  is situated about a mile from the village on the Commons Road. Beyond a small service of Buses to Drogheda    on Saturday there is no other Bus Service.There are three public houses, which are also provision shops, and there are three or four other small shops, Dwyer's being the most important. Numbers of people deal in Drogheda owing to the proximity of that town to Duleek.The streets are: Mains St. (?) St, Culligan St, Kings Gate, and the following lanes: Kevitts (?)

The Rocks of Carragubbin, DuleekThere is a place in Duleek and it is called Carragubbin.  There is a big hill and it is all rocks.  In the middle of the hill there is a cave and it is called the Fairies' Hole.  It is said that there is a tunnel running from there to a well called Tobar To in the Moat.There is another tunnel running to Cruiserath (called Coorse-rath) where there was an old church and down through the tunnel the people used to go to Mass. If anyone attacked them they could escape back that way or either they would go down the other tunnel to the Church in the Moat.It is called the Fairies' Hole because it is a sign that the fairies guard it every night, and would not let anyone in, and sometimes they would go out and play hurley in the field.  One time people were flying from the man that attacked them, and when they came to the mouth of the tunnel it was closed, and they all died with gold things with them.

Duleek Ghost StoriesThere are many ghost stories told about Duleek. There is a ghost at Weldon’s old house on the Abbey Road and it is told that there was a priest riding by, and the horse dies and he fell to the ground, and when the priest fell to the ground unconscious the priest dies in an hour. The marks of the horse’s hoofs are marked on the wall and a cross and a stone with blood stains on it.There is a bush growing beside this mark, and a man cut this bush, and when he was cutting it he cut the fingers off himself, and he dies not long after. His name was Thomas Connor. Every night there is a ghost there ever since. That bush is to be seen there, and whoever cuts that bush would not live long after it.

Local Heroes - Collier the RobberCollier, the Robber, was a native of the Hill of Bellewstown. When he grew up to manhood, he was a robber. He was brave and strong. He would rob the landlord and agent and give the money to the poor people. One time he was cauht and put in jail in Trim. The jail is along the Boyne.When he was in jail he had something that would cut iron and he cut the bars and tore the blankets and sheets that were under him and tied them together and then tied them to one of the bars. Then he slid down the rope he had made until he was far enough to jump into the Boyne. Then he swam across the river and escaped.Onetime he made a good lot of men with sticks and he made their heads with turnips and put guns in their hands and when the mail-coach was passing he walked out on the road and held it up. The people in the mail-coach thought the things along the ditch were men and they gave up all they had to Collier.Another time he saw a man going with the rent. He held him up and robbed him. When the man went home his wife asked him what did he do with the rent, did he go with the rent at all or did he gallop on the horse. Then he told her that he was robbed by Collier. They were very poor and they had not a bit to eat in the house. They were cursing

Collier. One day they saw the robber coming up the land. the man and woman of the house ran in and were waiting for Collier to catch him when he would go in. But it was not to rob them he was going, but to give them the money. He asked permission to go in and said he was going to give them money, and he said he heard of their poverty. He gave them more money than he robbed off them. They thanked him and they were never poor after that.Another time he saw a woman when he was going up a lane. HE went ....her and asked her what was on her. She said she could not pay the rent to the landlord and he came and another man with him and took the only coins she had. Then Collier got up on his horse and followed them. He caught them and they near home. He said to the landlord ""Your money or your life"". The man gave all his money to Collier. Then he brought the money back to the woman and she was never poor after that.The last year he was at the Races of Bellewstown he took a disease called the cholera. He died in Drogheda Poorhouse, and was buried with the light of a candle.Seán O Concubair, from a story told by his Grandfather Risteard (76 yrs old) Commons Duleek.

Collier the RobberCollier the Robber was born above at the Naul about a hundred years ago. When he was a young boy he used to be always walking about  at the road. One day his mother gave him a bit of bread, and when he was going down the Donore Road he saw a landlord going about in the field. So he hid in the ditch with a crust of bread. When the landlord came up he pointed the crust at him and told him to put his hands behind his back. The man thought he had a gun and Collier robbed him. He went home and gave the money to his mother.It is said that he took from the rich and gave to the poor.One moonlit night he was riding along the road on his horse and he saw the mail-coach coming. He knew that they would not be afraid of him by himself. So he tied his horse to a tree and put old hats on sticks of corn along the road and sticks pointing out like guns. When the mail-coach came up Collier jumped out of the ditch and shouted ""Fire, Fire"" When the men saw the sticks they thought it was an army and got out of the coach and ran away. Then Collier went .....and got all the money.When he was an old man he died of the cholera in Drogheda and there were only four at his funeral, the men that carried the coffin.When Collier was in prison one of the men

...........about 1787 Collier was born and he died 1847 the time of the famine. He was 6 feet in height and weighed over 14 stone. Collier was a man who did not like hard work, as he told the men he was working with one day in the field. ""No more of this for me"", he said. At that time the wages were very bad - good men could be had for 10d or a 11= per day. Yet the rent was very high, and price poor. The farmers found it very hard to pay the rent. Collier .....know the day the agent was coming to collect the rent, waited in ambush, and held up the agent, robbed him and gave teh money back to the poor farmers. Or if he made a fine haul he would enquire in Duleek Village who was the most deserving case and would help the families.........One day he met a little girl in the road going with her fathers dinner. He took it off her, and she began to cry and ran home and told her mother after a few nights Collier went to the house and gave them a lot of money.

The Weaving Industry of Duleek of Former TimesThe weaving industry of Duleek has long been a thing of the past. There was a time when in almost every house in the village there was a loom or more upon which materials were to be woven. As time passes by one would think it was a factory at work with the loom going. In Larrix St. alone there were up to thirty looms. They used to work from 5 O’clock in the morning till 11 O’clock at night. In Tierinan’s house in Cullingan St. there were as many as six looms. It was called the hand-loom weaving. Harness – ticking and bed-ticking were the materials made. They would weave shirting and towelling and carpets. There was a spinning wheel for winding the yarn.The man Peter Whearty who gave me this information was not able to tell when it first started in Duleek. But he said it must have been many many years ago. He remembers his father saying that in the time of the mail coach he often walked to Dublin in connection with the loom-weaving. He was what was called a master-weaver, a man of no education, but still was able to keep the books of account necessary. His son Peter remembers seeing dyers of books, account books one of which he thinks he still has. He is to let me see that book if he can put his hand on it.They used to buy the yarn in Drogheda in Ushers Mill. This yarn could be white, and would be dyed the colour wanted. That used to be wound in the looms

The old women used to wind the small balls, and the men the large ones. They would weave this into ticking and when this work was done the whole house would be engaged at it for about a week from early morning till late at night. There would be about 140 yarns in the roll when finished. This would be brought to Drogheda and given to the Calendon Mill in West St., where it would be to finishing-lineal – smoothing it out and taking the rough appearance off it. The master weavers had two rooms for themselves in the Linen Hall, Drogheda, and here they stocked their wears till market day every Saturday morning. For all this work they would be able to earn 10/- per week. This man Peter Whearty’s father did his business with Pins Bros. in Forges St in the forties. He used to go also to Carlow and Kilkenny. The man’s father died in the year 1881, and it was about this time the industry began to decline.This is a list of some of the weavers of Duleek:Curely’s, Kelly’s, Meads, Griffins, White’s, Fearon, Shalneys, Bervill, Owens, Wheartys, Tiernan (Kilsharvan).It was in the winter season they would work – harvesting and the raspberries used to occupy them in the other seasons.Ronan O’Brahain, Duleek Village from Peter Whearty (about 67) up Larrix St.

The industry of weaving was generally carried out in Duleek about twenty or thirty years ago. There was a loom in nearly every house in the place. When you would be going by you would hear the noise of the loom inside. They used to make ticking for making ticks foe beds. The ticking was all black and white strips.The looms used to be made of wood and they were so big that they nearly took up all the room in the kitchen. The weavers used to work the looms with their foot. There used to be a shuttle on the looms and the yarn which the ticking was made of used to be wound round them. When the weavers would have the ticking made they used to bring it to Drogheda, and sell it at 10/- a coil, and nearly always the would have to walk.The weavers used to be sitting up on the loom when it would be working. They used to take the ticking out of the loom like cloth. Some of the weavers used to make carpets and shirting. There is hardly a loom left in Duleek now. The people gave up working the looms because they were out of date with the machinery and there was no sale for the ticking. Before the weaver would start working the loom he would wind all the bobbins.Seamas O’Gorman from Liam O’Gorman (55), Commons, Duleek

The weaving industry stopped in Duleek many years ago. All the people of Duleek who had one would be up at six O’clock every morning, and weaving their piece, as they called it.  Then when they had a big bit weaved they would bring it over the street and wait there until someone would come with a horse and cart and bring it to Drogheda for them.Then they would sell it for two-pence a yarn. Kelly’s and White’s were the two best mills in Duleek. The mills were used for making ticking and mattresses. There would always be someone at the wheel and they would get ten pence a day, and they would have to work from six in the morning till ten at night.The poor people would have no clocks and would get up with the sound of the mills. It was a good help for the Duleek people and they missed them when they stopped.Stan O’Concinbaie

There is an old mill in Beaumond call Beaumond mill.  It was worked till about 40 years ago.  Then it got broken down, and two men came up from Belfast, and bought all the works and threw them away. It was let go to loss then.  The owner of it was Mr McCann and he lived in Beaumond House.  The reason it was stopped was because it was too far away from Drogheda, and they would have to bring all the corn from Drogheda, and when it would be ground bring it back in their horse and carts again.McCann joined in with a man from Bettystown called Mr Hill, and they set up a new mill in Drogheda called to day McCann and Hill.  While the mill was working in Beaumond there was an old man working at it and his name was Mallon.It was John Corry's father in the Commons Duleek. He was doing something at the mill and his coat caught in the works and he was dragged into the mill and ground up in pieces. My grandfather worked in the mill over fifty years ago, and he would have to be in before six o'clock when the Beaumond bell would ring.  They would get off at eight o'clock for their breakfast, for half an hour, and half an hour at one o'clock for their dinner; and work then till six for two shillings a day.There is another old mill in Duleek called the Duleek Mill. The owner of it was Mr Behan

It was a food mill, and did a roaring trade.  They used to grind white poplar trees and make flour of them. They used to sell the fire seeds at one penny per bushel.When it was broken down a man named Hanly a contractor came out from Drogheda, and bought all the things that were in it.  It was not steam it was worked by but by water from a little river called the Mill rise which is still there.  The poor people of Duleek missed the mill when they stopped because they were getting work and fire seeds. All the men that worked at Behan's mill were only getting 9 shillings a week.

There are many places about Duleek where it is said there were old churches long ago.  It was said there was an old church in Cruicerath, and it was joined by a tunnel to another church in Platten. The church in Cruicerath was built on a big rock, and it was knocked down about three months ago.There was a Church in the Moat in Duleek long ago and the roof of it was knocked down by a strong wind hundreds of years ago.There was a church in Knockisland too, and the door was so small that the people had to go in on their hands and knees.About a thousand years ago a Church was built in  Castlerag (Duleek - in Col.Smith's land) by a man called Kelly.  It was not long built until the Danes plundered it and took away all the valuable things, and killed the priests and monks.It is said that Brian Boru was waked for a night in the old church in the graveyard.The first stone church in Ireland is to be seen in Mr Patrick Donnelly's field to this day.It is said that there was an old Convent long ago where Mr. Dowling's house now stands.

St. Cianan, Patron of DuleekIn the Bolies, there is a place where there was a church and school. There are very few stories about it, and the well. The place where the church was is now owned by Mr. Wall, and it is about a quarter of a mile from the road. It is supposed to have been levelled by the Cromwellian soldiers. The stone in the walls was brought away for building somewhere else.

The Wells of Duleek - St. CiaránThere is a well in Keeogue, and it is called St. Ciaráns well. It is said that St. Ciarán lived in Keenogue for years. There is a story told that the saint met his mother out in the fields one time, and she asked him for a drink. There being no well, near him St. Ciarán made a ring round on the grass, and a smaller one in the middle. Just then the ground began to get wet and the well started up and a little cup in it so that his mother can get the drink. That same well is to be seen yet in Mr. Loughnan's Field. It is said to have never run dry. The monks of Duleek are said to have built a little house over the well, so that it would be safe.There is a well in Garballagh called Tobar Mollise. Garballagh is said to have been a little village at one time. There is a well in Downtown called the Cloch Liath.In Shallow there is a well called St. Columcilles well. There is a statue of Columcille in the well wall. There is a well called the Shamrock Well in front of Mr. Dowlings house. There used to be a well near Traynor's shop called the Pound Well. The big well on the East Commons is said to never run dry. This well was once one of the greatest wells in Ireland.

2. The Wells of Duleek St Cianáns Well.There is an ancient well at Keenogue, Duleek, called St. Cianáns well and this is how the well got that name. There was a boy one time called Cianán working in Keenogue. The job he had was keeping the birds out of the wheat. This time his mother was living in a little house in Keenogue, and she was very sick. They had a wake in the house, and she wanted a drink. When Cianan came in for his dinner she told him she wanted a drink. At that time he had a little bit of a stick in his hand, and he put it in the ground, and the well sprang up, and when his mother saw that she told all the people that her son Cianán made a well in the room by her side, they all looked surprised and would not believe him. The Sunday after that, the Walsh's were going to mass and they left Cianán behind them to mind the wheat. And they told him not to go to mass. Then he began to gather the crows and he put then in the barn. Then he went to Mass.When Mass was over the Walsh's saw Cianán and began to fight with him for leaving the wheat unminded. Then he told them he put them into the barn. When they went home they opened the barn door and out came all the crows. They knew that he was a saint and they called the well St. Cianán's well. It is 6 feet deep. There is no wall round the well. Séan O'Concubair ó n-a shean athair Risteárd (76)

The Wells of Duleek.Tobar Mollish is in the townland of Little Garballagh. It belonged to Geraghty's of the East Commons formly. Over 100 years ago people would come in hundreds to it on the 1st Sunday of the harvest. The people would believe the cure of ""eqa"" (aqua) was in it. Everyone that would make a station would tie a bit of ribbon on the bushes round it. You would think it was a clothes-line with all the ribbon on it. On a very dark night there would be great lights seen round it, and the strangest thing about it is that on the hottest day in Summer no cattle would put their feet in it, although, there is nothing to protect it. It used to be surrounded by very large trees and there are only 2 left now. Even on the hottest day in Summer it flows over the fields. A man was cutting a tree one time, and he stopped to get his dinner, and when he came back it was standing as before as thick as four trees, and the mark of the saw in it. Nobody even takes a stick out of it because Thomas Heavey brought home a log out of it one night, and just put it on the fire. There was a fire in the grate at the time, and it burned away. A man saw a map of Garballagh 300 years ago and Tobar Mollish was on it. It would be about 5 yards square. Tobar

There was a man living in Duleek long ago, and his name was Owen Burley. He used to be working on the railway, and one time they were working down at Plattin. One dark night he was going home from his work and he went across the Commons. He kept going on for about an hour and still there was no sign of anything about.  He thought he could see a big hedge on every side of him. When he would try to get to it, it would be as far away as ever. Then he turned his coat inside out and daw a light coming from behind a bush, and when he followed it he found himself in a bog and could not get out. The light went out and he thought it must have been ""Jack the Lantern."" When a man found him in the morning he was forst bitten.There was a woman going to milk cows in the fields near to the Commons, and she saw something while in the middle of the field. But she never got over to it that night because she stood on a stray sod and was going round in a ring the whole time.

This old industry was first started about 150 years ago, about the year 1788.  There were about sixty families engaged in the hand-weaving industry, which was the in flourishing industry in Duleek.  It was with a view of getting a few hours sunshine and air each day, and at the same time gain some profit for the hours spent (that the industry was founded).  The loom operation was indoors, weaving from early morning until late in the evening.  For the above reason raspberry production was first commenced.The raspberry canes or plant in some cases were found growing wild in bog and woodland and can be found even today growing wild in different parts of Ireland.  Some of these canes were found growing wild near Duleek.  They were carefully ""lifted"" and  planted in a nursery bed and they in time produced spawn or succession in great numbers.  The young canes were then planted in ""beds"".  Canes were also imported from Scotland about this period.  Some of the families engaged in raspberry production in these old times were - McCabes, Conlons, White, Drumgooles, Garveys, Misses, Hoeys, Finnigans and McKeever.  Some of these old families are even today engaged in fruit production.   The holdings owned by these people were small in area, from one [?] to one

The growers in these days did not completely derive their livelihood from the raspberry production, as most of them had the weaving as other means of support.  It was about this time that the adjoining village of Julianstown, and Gormanstown went into raspberry production.  But the area under raspberries in Duleek was greater than these two villages, as they went in more for apples, gooseberries and plums.

plant.  This plant may take a different strain from the parent plant, but  in quite a few instances it turned out quite a distinct variety.  In many cases the variety was very poor indeed and not worth planting.   In some cases, however the variety was very good, and bore fruit of excellent quality and flavour.  The growers who produced such variety nurses it, and produced cane from it.  These canes were not named after the grower who produced them except on rare occasions.  They got their name from the appearance of cane or of its fruit.  The names of most of the old varieties are as follows:- The Thimble - Fruit resembled a thimbleThe Crooked One - Canes were crookedThe Straight Line - Canes were tall and straightThe Cane - Resembled a caneThe grower now selected the cane from a young bed usually from two to three years old.  These canes grew from buds produced by the parent plant roots.  The reason for taking the canes from a young plantation was : the roots were very fibrous and take root in their new ground better.  The ground previously prepared as already mentioned is now in a suitable condition for planting.  Planting took place in the months of October, February &

leaves and fruiting pods.  The young plant bear very little fruit the first year, about 40 to 50 lbs per acre.  The fruit is not of course borne on the young shoot in succession - it is borne on the old parent plant that was originally planted and cut to 9 inches.  About the month of November, after the potatoes are lifted the old parent plant by this time has died back and they were all cut at the ground level.  The new shoots on succession by this time had grown to a height of from 3 to 4 feet. They were then tied, 3 ties to each tying.  The plantation would now be kept as free from weeds as possible by scrapping or hoeing.  When March arrived the ground between the rows would be lightly forked over to a depth of only a few inches.  It takes about 3 years before the raspberry plantation come in to full production.  The canes by this time have increased in number and reach a height of from 41/2 to 6 feet, depending on the variety.  The treatment applied to an established plantation was as follows:In the month of January and February the rows were examined, and any canes found growing out of place were taken up.  This kept rows straight and provide sufficient space for working between the rows.  Next came the pruning and tying.  The pruning is done with a hooked knife with a handle attached about 18 inches long called a pruning hook.  All the cane that had become fruit the previous summer, and which had since died back were cut out and tied in bundles to be

used later for starting fires in the homes and for burning weeds.  The plantation was again gone over with the pruning fork, and any cane that were weak, or where there was too many in number, these were also cut out.  Tying now commences.  The tyings were made with twine and sallies.  The twine was made made by the weaver by twisting cotton threads together: they were very fast and expert at this business.  Thesally was, however, the favourite tying as most of the growers could make a quicker tying with it.  There was, however, a particular variety of sally used for this purpose, called the red sally.  There were quite a large number of sally trees used for this purpose growing in marshy part or the Commons.  The one-year old shoots were cut from these trees usually by the school children who sold them to growers for a penny a bunch.  The bunch was about 3 inches in diameter.  The raspberry cane were tied in clumps of 3 to 4 cane in each clump.  The rows of canes were tied in such a manner that when you stood [?] [?] at the row, and  looked on the rows of canes, they appeared set like the teeth of a saw.  The idea for this method was that it gave you free access to sunshine and air, and allowed the young shoots space to grow up without choking.

them easy to pile on top of one another.  This depression prevented slipping when loaded for transport.The raspberry being a very perishable fruit had to be marketed very soon after picking.  The system in operation in these days was as follows:-The fruit was loaded onto horse-drawn cart in the evening.  These carts were fitted with [?] so that from 100 to 140 tubs could be loaded in.  These cart were supplied by the larger growers.  There were usually 6 - 8 carts for this purpose.  The cart now loaded up, they commenced their long journey to Dublin fruit market, then the old Anglesea market which was a distance of 19 Irish miles from Duleek.  The road travelled in these days was the old Duleek - Dublin Road via Ardcath, as the new Duleek - Kilmoon road was not as yet constructed.  The fruit market opened at 4am so that it was necessary for the card to travel during the night.On arrival at the market the carts were unloaded and the fruit placed on the commission saleman's stands, this to be sold by auction to the biggest bidder.  The purchasers were usually merchants who would distribute the fruit to the ""Housewives"" for making jam.  By this method the fruit found its way into many homes in Ireland.  The price received by the grower in these days was from 2/6 to 4/6 per tub, depending of course on supply and demand.

Sugar in those days was expensive, and jam a luxury.As the years advanced production of raspberries increased and marketing methods changed. Dublins only jam factory in the year 1886 was Craig's of Mespil Road. This factory bought its factory requirements in the Dublin fruit market. The fruit required for the purpose would be sent by road in the ordinary way in kegs or barrels and would be in a riper condition than the fruit sent in tubs. The factory more or less stablilised the price at the market. It was about at this point, too, that the Dueek growers exported raspberries to Liverpool. The fruit was sent in large oak casks from Drogheda Harbour. These casks held from 8 to 10 cwt of fruit. The exporting of the fruit in this manner only lasted a few years as its district of Blairgowery and of the producing areas of Seollan and Hyand had extended their areas under raspberries and were supplying their home markets, and even sending quantities to Belfast and Dublin.In the year 1892 there were agents appointed in Duleek by Belfast Jam manufacturing firms to purchase on behalf of the firm large quantities of raspberries. This fruit was sent out by rail from Duleek G.N.R. in kegs. The firms supplies in this manner were: Messrs Millan, and

Messrs Chapmans.It was about this period, too, that Craig's Dublin Factory was purchased by Messrs. William and Woods who were previously employed in the Confectionery business at Parnell St. This firm transferred the jam manufacturing from Mespil Road to their Parnell St. premises. This firm purchased the fruit in the usual way in the Dublin market for several years. In the year 1906 the firm appointed an agent in Duleek to purchase large quantities of raspberries. In the year 1910 the punnet system of marketing fruit appears in New Corporation Fruit Market, Dublin.The old familiar ""click-clack"" of the weavers hand loom had by this time ceased in Duleek because modern power driven looms were now in operation - the large towns and cities turning out material at great speed and at a very lower price. The punnet system of marketing was found a very satisfactory method of sending the fruit to Dublin and the prices obtained were very satisfactory. The punnet was a very light chip-wood container which held a pound of raspberries. These punnets when filled with fruit were packed into a lease or slab which held 32 punnets. The fruit sent to market in this manner was sold for dessert and bottling purposes, and was picked in a firm condition slightly under ripe. In 1915 Motor

transport was first used for the conveyance of fruit to Dublin market and to Dublin's only Jam Factory, William's & Wood's. In 1917 however there were new entrants into the jam manufacturing  business. The highest prices obtained for raspberries from jam firms was during the World War when £130 per ton was obtained. The lowest price ever obtained was £10 per ton. This was the price in the year 1889. Large quantities of the fruit in this year were left unpicked; due of course to its uneconomic price.The area under cultivation at the present time (1938) in the old raspberry districts of Duleek, Gormanston, Julianstown and Stamullen areas exceed 80 acres. These areas produced in 1937 2/3 of the Irish Free State raspberry requirement. The quantity supplied in the year was over 200 tons. There are now 10 firms engaged in the jam production in Eire.The number of families now engaged in raspberry production in the Meath fruit Districts number over 150. Many of these families depend soley on fruit production for a livelihood. The industry now brings into Meath's fruit districts up to £7000 per year, depending of course on price and weather conditions. During the life of the industry there were many obstacles met with and the price obtained were after totally unsatisfactory due to the importation of foreign fruit,

Here in our own Village Cromwell did great damage. Before he came we had a very nice monastery, also a beautiful steeple in our graveyarde, and besides  that was what we claim to be the first stone church in Ireland. All those were destroyed. In the monestery all the nuns & priests were killed.The steeple he levelled almost to the ground. He placed his cannon guns on the rocks convenient to the Railway Station about one mile away and from that he fired his guns and left it almost in ruins. The same he did with the stone church on the opposite side of the lane to where the steeple is situated.At that time the Catholics were greatly persecuted and on one occasion he took a Catholic man up to the top of the steeple and told him if he informed on the Catholics in this place he would give him all the land he could see around him. The man said all he wanted was his own, but Cromwell insisted and he gave him his land at the small rate of 1'2d per acre provided he went to a Protestant service once a year. This man's name was Stapleton. This the unfortunate man did, himself and his family every year, but they did not enjoy their farm very long. Little as the rent was [?] got unable (to pay it) and they were left on the road.

Cromwell and his men came to Duleek a short time after he being in Drogheda. While he was drawing near Duleek, a man the name of Stapleton went out to meet him and informed him about where the nuns and monks were hiding in Duleek. The words that he said to Cromwell were - ""The fox is still in his den."" By this he meant that the monks were still hiding in Duleek, and had not gone anywhere else. Then Crowell went into Duleek, and captured all the nuns & the valuable things they had with them.When all was over Cromwell took Stapleton up to the top the Steeple, and he gave him all the land around, as far as his eye could see, and Stapleton would have to pay no rent for it. When Cromwell's soldiers were going in and out through  the peoples' house in the hunt a man ran out with a [?] and a halter and put one of Cromwell's soldiers in it and hung him. But then the other soldiers killed the man with Cromwell looking at them.

When Cromwell came to Duleek first he and his men were very hungry. They went looking round Duleek for something to eat. When he came to Stapletown a man called Dickie [?] brought Cromwell in, and asked him would he eat meat. Cromwell said he would. Then the Stapleton's gathered up all their cattle and got them killed. Then he got boilers and boiled the cattle for the soldiers and Cromwell, and when they had finished Cromwell was delighted and game them land along the Bogloch lane.Another time he was on the street with his soldiers and a woman was coming up the street for water. She had a child with her. She was walking by the soldiers, and one of them killed her. Cromwell was vexed at this, and gathered up his men and asked them who killed her. He got no answer; then he asked again and said, ""I will give the highest part in Drogheda."" Then the man said it was he. Cromwell then told some of his men to put him in a cart and bring him out to Drogheda, and hang him out at the [?]It was Cromwell who knocked down the churches at Patrick Farrelly's and in the old churchyard.

The men and boys in Duleek long ago used to play games that are not played at all now. One game they used to play was ""Jars"". They used to get a jar, a small thing made of flint about the size of an egg or so. Those that are playing stand at a kind of a bob, and throw buttons or marbles at the jar. There would be a lad standing inside in a ring around the jar, and for every button or marble that would hit the jar he would have to give one to whoever hit it. But if they missed it, they would have to give him one.PebbAnother game they used to play was Pebb. Everyone that is playing puts a marble in a hole. In turns they try to hit the marble with another marble, and whoever succeeds in hitting them gets the whole lot.Cat in the HoleThey would dig two holes and get a little peg. Then one would get a stick, and would try to stop the other from ""going the peg into the hole from the other hole. Every time the other lad would hit the stick or peg he would make runs.When the marble season would be over in Duleek, they used to play a game called Duleek. One lad would put a marble on the road, and the other throw his marble at it and try to break it.

Long ago in Duleek on May Eve the men and boys used to light a bonfire. They used to rub two bones or flint stones together. After a while a blaze would come, and with it they would light a wad of hay that they had lit all the other bonfires with, and they would keep over the same wad of hay to light the May fire the next year.They would have a very big ash butt in the middle of the fire, with all the furze and other sticks on top of it. They would never burn any furze that would be in bloom. Then they would sit round the fire and they telling stories.Not far away from the bonfire all the girls would have a May bush. The day befoe they would gather all the flowers and keep them in water. Then they would tie them on the branches of the bush. They would stick candle or the dalks. they would sing a song round the May bush that would not be sung throughout all the year until then, and they would not sing it until the May Day again. When all would be over, they would take the 'Plover-Skins' (Plobairscín - marsh marigold) off the May bush and throw them into the fire. Then everyone would come along in turns, and take a bit of the ashe, and keep it in their pocket.

Long ago in Duleek on May Eve the boys would go away through the field for a May bush. When they would cut down the bush, they would trim it and bring it home.When they would reach home the girls would have a good heap of flowers tied in little bunches.When the girls would hang all the flowers on the bush they would all go for sticks and furze. When they would come back with the sticks they would build a ring of stones round the May bush, with one stone in the middle.Then some of them would tie butts of candles on the May bush, while the rest of them would set the fire. Then some of the boys would stay at the May bush and mind it while the rest of them would go home for their supper. When they would come back the boys who were minding the May bush would go home for their supper.When they would all be ready they would send someone round for the people. Then they would send for the fiddler, and he would sit on the stone under the May bush while the old people would sit on the stones round the May bush. Then the fiddler would start playing the fiddle while the people would dance. It would be a beautiful sight to look at the bush with all the candles in it.

One of the oldest May day customs in Duleek was to light a very great May-fire.For about two weeks before May day the older boys of Duleek would go round the country robbing fenced gaps. If you were caught at this you would be put in jail. They would take gates off their hinges, and would rob all the gaps in Duleek.They would light the fire in the middle of the Commons where nobody would see them. They would be up all night at the fire. They would dance and sing round it all night. They would burn all the gates and hedges and gaps. About twenty boys would be round it. They would start the fire at about 12 o'clock when nobody would see who they were. The next morning the farmers would come to look at the gaps, but to their surprise, there would be not there.The women also make a May bush, and have all sort of flowers and presents and ribbons. They would be gathering flowers, all sorts of flowers, for it. It would be laden with primroses, violets, Cowsslips, and Wall flowers, and would have coloured candle on it.

It was  the custom in olden times in Duleek on May Eve to get a big heap of furze, and a great thorn bush and put a lot of flowers and butts of candles, and to put the thorn bush in the middle of the furze and then they would light the furze, and when they would have a big blaze everybody would catch hands and go dancing and singing all round the fire to welcome in the month of May the beginning of summer. And when all the old people would hear the young children dancing and singing they would come and join them also. And some of the old people would make tea and have a kind of a tea-party. When the fire would be burned down to ashes the people would throw the May bush into the fire, and then all the candles and flowers would light up in a big blaze.

Keenoge is a townland situated about a mile from the village of Duleek, on the Dublin Road. There are many houses newly built there now, but 30 years ago when I came to Duleek first it was without a single house. The three labourer's Cottges were built on the land of Col. Smith of Duleek, & after the Great War land was divided there amongst ex-soldiers and houses built thereon. Amongst those ex-soldiers was Jams Loughran of Duleek, who had joind the British Army in response to the appeal of John Redmond, Loughran being and enthusiastic member of the United Irish League. On his land were some sand-pits, and it was when working these sand-pits that the discoveries I am going to describe were made.Early in 1929 Professor Mac Allister was giving a lecture in Drogheda. After the Lecture the Professor was told by W. J. [?], architect in Drogheda, that some time ago a farmer in Kennoge, James Loughran, had found on his land some old vessels when digging for sand.Dr. Maher of the National Museum was instructed to deal with the matter. He visited Keenoge immediately. He discovered that what James Loughran found was a large urn which he thought belonged to the period of 500 B.C.He found also that two other large vessels of the same burial got broken. The burial itself

was a cist - it was a kind of a chest with rows of stones, and a stone on top. The big urn contained cremated ashes. In the field itself there was nothing to indicate burial, no mound on the [?], and it was uncertain if one would be found.A few weeks later James Loughran let Dr. Maher know that he had come upon another burial. This was a male Skeleton laid out on a pavement of slabs, five feet under the surface. The body was interred in a crouched position facing the rising sun, but it was not protected by anything from pressure of the earth which deformed the skull considerably. A small food-vessel was found near the legs, another was near the head (along with a small bronze dagger.) but had been broken by a stone.Searching for other graves they came upon the Skeleton of a child, and the Skeleton of a grown-up person, in a crouching position. Near the head was a broken food-vessel, but it had been smashed. It is said that a necklace was round the neck.Continuing his investigation Dr. Maher and James Loughran came upon another cist. The top slabs were hidden under a pile of smaller stone, and the whole thing had the appearance of a small cairn, but the top was more than a foot under the surface.

Outside the cist were 2 food-vessels placed on opposite sides of the long stones. The cist was found to hold another Skeleton, in a crouched position, with a food vesel, both very well preserved, and resting on a pavement of small flags.Later still they excavated two very small cists with pavements, The Skeleton of an infant was got in one of them.Only in 1935 - so late as that - Dr Maher was summoned again to Keenoge. James Loughran had come upon another grave on his land. It was found to contain a beautiful earthenware vessel - a food vesel. This was the ninth find of the type found on Loughran's land.The most perfect of the finds made in Keenoge had been taken up in segments to the National Museum in Dublin, and has been re-constructed exactly as it was, close beneath the surface of historic Keenoge.

The people of Duleek long ago had a great lot of ways for lighting their homes. One was with rushlights. Long ago the men and women in Duleek, used go along the banks of the rivers and gather the big thick rushs that grew there. They used to call them bullrushes. They used to bring them home and dry then at the fire. Then they would leave them out in the sun. Then when they would be dry they used to skin them, and then steep then in brown stuff like grease. Then they would take them out after a couple of days. Then they used to tie two or three of the rushes together Then they would light them and they would not burn out for about two weeks.They used to be out where the flaggers grow and pull up the part where it is wet and coloured red at the butt. Then they would cut it to about two or three inches long. They would malke a hole in it then and run one or two thin rushes throught the hole for a wick. They would light the wick then and it could burn for a good while. But these lights are not as good as the light made of the bull-rushes.

The Battle of the Boyne took place in the year 1690. Our own village was very much connected with it. It was fought between King James and King William at the River Boyne about four miles away.The evening before the battle King James stayed here for a night in a castle about three miles from the village. This castle is called Athcarne Castle, the home of the Downdall's at the time.He had been also invited to stay in [?] House, and on that account, the people who lived there had a special room built to the house for the King to remain the night in, but to their great disappointment he passed on to Athcarne Castle. Up to this present time anyone who wished to see the rooms in the castle is at liberty to do so.Next day he went to the Battle to meet King William of Orange, King Willaim was son-in-law of King James.the Battle started and after a few shots were fired King James fled leaving his men to the mercy of King William.The Irish were badly trained and under bad leadership. They could not possibly have won.There is a story told about King James, that when he arrived back in Dublin he met an Old Duchess who he told the Irish fled and she replied ""

The Battle of the Boyne was fought in the year 1690. It was fought at a place not far from Duleek, Oldbridge. King James and King William that were fighting at it. William won the battle and when James saw that he fled away. He came down a lane that runs through Clonlusk and [?], called Freelan Lane; he then galloped across the Commons on his horse and went into Duleek at King's Gate. There used to be an old black gate here, and a wall alongside of it. When James arrived here, he got off his horse, and sat up on the wall, to rest himself. Then someone told him that William's soldiers were near Duleek. He was in such a hurry going, that he forgot his sword, and it was found years after. Then he went down the King's lanes that are called after him.On Mr. Toaffe's land in Clonlusk, is a big rocky place and it is a cave called the Cobbler's Hole. It this cave, James's soldiers stored a lot of guns. William came down the [?] Road with his soldiers. some of them came marching from Rosnaree, but Sarfield's men mety them at the Bog of Thomastown and drove them back. When Willaim came to the top of the Red Mountains and looked down and saw such good land down below, he said to the soldiers and men

They are to be seen still at Carragagh.----The Battle of the Boyne was a very great battle. After the battle King James fled toward Duleek. It is supposed that he came down by Carragublin and across the Commons and down by the King's Gate.When the soldiers came to the Nanny Bridge they stopped and put up the last fight, and gave James a chance to get away to Dublin.But the soldiers at the Bridge could not fight William's soldiers and were killed. All that got away were followed, but the soldiers could only get some of them. There was a captain coming with a small band of soldiers from the chase. When he was at Keenoge, a number of King Jame's men attacked then and killed them. Then they ran away. When the soldiers of Williams saw their comrades dead, they buried them in a field at Keenoge. When they were burying them they put them into the graves with their swords on. They buried the captain in a stone grave, and put a big stone over it, this way they would know where he was buried. A few years after, they took up the stone and put it in the Churchyard of Duleek.

The people of Duleek had a number of old customs when anyone would die.When anyone would die long ago, the people would all go to the home where the wake would be. The corpse would usually be lying on an old door, in the middle of the floor, or in a bundle of straw. All the people would take a pinch of snuff when they would go into the house.When all would be settled, and all the people at the wake, the pipes and the tobacco would be given out. Then all the people would begin to tell stories and about twelve oclock they would say 10 de Profundis. Then the people would start to go home about five or six to be ready for their work. They would nearly all be drunk going home.Some times the people would not be able to buy a coffin, and they would have to make a collection, and if they could not get enough money to buy one, they would have to make one themselves.If they had to bring the corpse a long distance they would bring it on a horse and cart.The farmers would follow the funeral on horses.

They used to keep the people in the house for the 3 days and not bring them to the chapel at all but bring them from the house  to the grave yard. When a person would die the people in the house used to stop the clock and not put it on again until the funeral had left the house.They used to play games at the wake long ago. When the people would be sitting round the fire, one would go round with his hands joined and a button in it and all the others would have their hands the same way. Then the person with the button would go to everyone and say ""Here is the button, and be sure you have it"", and he would put it in one of the people's hands. Then the others would guess who had it. If they guessed wrong, they would get a blow of a strap. Some people know when a person is lying, because they smell the smell of clay, and call it ""the whiff on the clay""

In the night they put an apple into a tub of water, and they try to take it out with their mouth; or tie one to a cord hanging out on the ceiling and catch it in their mouth too.Many of the boys long ago used to go round the house and knock loudly at the peoples' doors and go away again befoe anyone came out. The people would be expecting this and would not be near the door.Long ago the man used to put light at the gate and other places to frighten the people if they saw them - many people believe that all the ghosts are out and walking about that night, and they would be afraid of seeing one of them if they went outside that night.

Nearly everyone in Duleek has potatoes growing in the garden. Some years the people plant more than other years. First of all they open the drills with a shovel or a plough, and scatter some manure along in the furrows. By that time the seed potatoes have been cut, and an ""eye"" must be left in each part. A handful of lime is shaken in over the potatoes in a bucket, and as the potatoes are taken out the lime sinks down through them. There must be 30 inches between the centres of each drill.The potatoes are dropped in the furrow in top of the manure. They then come along and fill in the furrow with a fork or with a shovel again :- The clay falling down on each side in the furrows. When they are planting therm on the green sod they plant them in ridges. They turn up the sod and spread the manure over them. In ridges the furrows are about 3 feet apart. The potatoes are dropped in the ridge and covered with the clay in the furrow. When the stalk of the potatoes get too far away from the clay, they ""law"" them.In Sept. the potatoes are dug out, and put in a pit. They empty then in the place they are going to make the pit, and arch them up. A layer of straw is then put over them

About a hundred years ago there was a terrible big wind. It happened about the year 1839. It is said that this terrible wind rose on the Bog of Allan and it only had a certain breadth with it because there were parts that it did not touch at all.It is said that it was going at the rate of 90 miles an hour. It did terrible destruction everywhere and it did not leave any thatch on the houses for miles around. It started at eleven in the night and did not cease until the next day. It was worse up on the hill than down low. It knocked a big building in Bellewstown, and nearly blew down the chapel in Ardcath. In some houses the delph   was even shaking on the dresser, with the force of the wind outside.There was another great wind on the 26th February 1903. It was also very strong and took thatch and galvanize off the house. Some people have not got the galvanize it was carried that far.Seumas O'Gormáin,Station Rd.

Churning 187There are many houses about Duleek in which the churning is done regularly. Many people have churns in the house though we have none. The churns that some of them have is a dash-church. This kind churn goes in a little bit down from the top and then widens out again. If you went into a house and they churning they would tell you to take your turn at the churning afraid you would bring the butter home. Sometimes it takes longer than others to do the churning. When using the dash they move it up and down through the hole in the middle of the lid. They have to wait until the milk gets thick before they put it in the churn, and then pour in boiling water. When the butter appears on the handle of the dash they take it out with little wooden things and do not tip it with their hands. They put it in a dish and put salt in it after they washed it.

Churning 288.In every farmers house in Duleek long ago, they used to churn with the dash churn. The churns long ago were a lot different from the churns used now. Churning is a very hard job in Summer, because butter is very hard to make. There are not so many people making butter or churning now. If you went into a farmers house and they churning, they would get you to dash, for you to churn a little for luck. When the butter would be made they had a wooden kind of a plate for lifting it out of the churn. Then they would cut a bit of wheaten bread and put fresh butter for you to eat. You would think you never ate anything like it with the wheaten bread and the pure country butter. Seamus MacCeonnaire, Drogheda Road, ó Seamus MacCeonnaire, Drogheda Road.

Christmas 289When the pudding is being made everyone of the family takes their turn in stirring it. It is said to be lucky.In some houses, but very few, a candle is put into the window. They believe that the Blessed Virgin and Jesus Christ come into every house at midnight. The candle is to show them the way. The door is not locked that night either. It used to be a custom that on the night of Christmas Eve, the family would sit around the fire and tell ghost stories. Enda O'Boyle, Duleek, from his mother (50..)

Evictions in Duleek. 190.There were not many evictions about Duleek, but still there were some. People of the name of Hatch were the rent-warners for the agent. About this time people called Branningans used to live in the bug house at the Cross. The priest of Duleen used to live with them. This manowed about a years rent and when the year was uphe was given three days to pay if not to be forced our of his house. When the man did not pay the rent and did not leave the house, the landlord and the sheriff came with a few griffers. They went into the house, took the the furniture and left it on the road. That night the Hatches went to live in the house. The Brannigan man had to sleep in a kind of hut along the road with the roof made of flaggers.A short time after this one of the Hatches whose name was Charlie was shot down in Culligan Street, not far form the Nanny Bridge and it was thought that it was one of the Brannigans that did it. When they would be evicting any of the poor people they would set fire to the thatch. If anyone built a shed on the farm for cattle the landlord would raise the rent and so the people used to have to bring the cow and the hens with the house. It is said that a big band of tinkers came to Duleek and when they saw the waste land

Bronze Age Battle-AxeFound about 20 years ago on the ""White Rock"" about 2 miles from Duleek. Dr. Mahon of the Museum, Dublin, gave the following description of the above axe to a representative of the ""Drogheda Independent"". The description was published in the edition of 16/2/'35:-""A beautiful little axe, of large dimensions, with strongly-curved cutting edge, a well-drilled hole for the shaft and a protruding knob at the end, has been deposited in the National Museum, Dublin by Mr. Willian Taaffe, of Newtown, Duleek, Co. Meath.The object is about 6 inches in length, and is made of a very

elastic rock, of dark greenish colour, and was originally most carefully polished, as can be seen from the parts of its surface which have not been exposed to erosion by atmospheric influence. On the upper and lower side there are two semi-circular cavities, which accentuate the skillful shape of the weapon, and the shaft hole passes right through the centre of these two depressions. The two depressions are both marked by a raised circumference which is ornamental by its deeply raised lines towards the centre portion of the axe itself, as can plainly be seen from the drawing accompanying the report. The axe had been found some 20 years ago on the very top of that peculiar outcrop of rock which bears the local name of ""The White Rock"", and which is a well known landmark of the district. At some other date there was found in close vacinity a stone hammer of oval shape, made of black basalt, a find which corroborated the conclustion to be drawn from the find of the battle-axe, that there must have been some prehistoric inhabitation on that site in the distant past. The battle-axe is a most beautiful

representaton of a rare type, of which the National Museum of Ireland contains up to some 20 specimens whilst a few other ones exist in the Belfast Museum and amongst the Irish Material which found its way into the large museums of Britain. The battle-axe belongs to an advanced sub-period of the early Bronze Age, and can positively be dated about 1600 or 1300 B.C. Although the cutting-edge is not now as sharp as it must have been in the past, it must have been a formidable weapon when new, and it is a most welcome addition to the National Museum, which is under a great debt of obligation to Mr. Taaffe for the loan of it"".

The following legend is connected with Friday:-Long ago a man built a shop in a street in this village. He stocked the shop very well & started business on Wednesday. When he left the shop that night he forgot to put out the fire. An old mat in front of the fireplace went on fire from a spark which came from the dying embers. The shop was completely burned before any-one discovered the fire. Another man started a business on Thursday in the same street. It was also destroyed.A third man started a business on Friday & it flourished. This gave rise to the opinion that Friday was the luckiest day on which to embark on any enterprise.

Next day he went to the spot where he fell and saw a mark on the road and a donkey eating grass nearby.  He knew it was the donkey that he had fallen across, nevertheless, he did not pass that way at night again.Told by John corryDuleekAged 64
